## Earth SVG

When I created the earth graphic in 1999 I soon realized it would become the logo or symbol of my new domain, unsaturated.com. My salad days of graphical dabbling focused on raster graphics.  I didn't know anything else because that's what PaintShop Pro emphasized. Every human factors engineer should look back at his earlier work and learn from that experience. Smack your forehead, shake your head, but always _learn_. 

I used [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/) to build this logo. In total, the process is very similar to creating the raster version but with SVG it's easier to dissect the process into a series of unions, intersections, or difference procedures. I started with the basic ellipse shape and then added objects which would be used to parse the globe into its constituent pieces. 

<div class="container">
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <figure class="figure">
            {% image "01-globe-progress1.png",
            "Getting the right elliptical shapes",
            [320, 940],
            "50vw, 100vw",
            "figure-img img-fluid rounded"
            %}
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Getting the right elliptical shapes</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

Object intersections and differences yield the final four parts of the globe.  These steps were very easy and took only a few minutes.  I spent a few minutes on alignment since the process of adding, removing, copying/pasting is rather disruptive. 

<div class="container">
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <figure class="figure">
            {% image "02-globe-progress2.png",
            "Color and separation",
            [450, 900, null],
            "450px, 900px, 100vw",
            "figure-img img-fluid"
            %}
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Color and separation</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

The green hemisphere of the globe took a bit more work. I'm still learning various techniques to ensure nodes intersect properly. Nodes are the points that define a shape. Paths, which are defined with a sequence of nodes, are harder to manipulate. Like so many problems there are often multiple ways to get the same result. Finally, adding a dash of color finishes the job. 

<div class="container">
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <figure class="figure">
            {% image "03-globe-progress3.png",
            "Final rendering and my avatar across the web",
            [450, 900, null],
            "450px, 900px, 100vw",
            "figure-img img-fluid"
            %}
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Final rendering and my avatar across the web</figcaption>
        </figure>

## Redline Advertising

My friend needed a logo for his class...and *fast*. In under one hour I whipped up this gem and set a personal best for quality and speed. We discussed the merits of using a tachometer but he was adamant. For some people "red line" can only mean one, inevitable logo. 

The whole design is too contrived. Also, the black text blends in with the black bezel of the tachometer; the gray shadow mitigates the problem only slightly. The tachometer should be cropped off or fade when it intersects with the text.

<div class="container">
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <figure class="figure">
             {% image "04-redline.png",
            "Actually, there are several red lines",
            [316, 632, null],
            "316px, 632px, 100vw",
            "figure-img img-fluid"
            %}
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Actually, there are several red lines</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>

## Somewhere, 2001

During the summer of 2001 I was interning at Walt Disney Imagineering Scientific Systems. Overall, it was a good experience and the side activities made it even better. The _Digital Art Show_ is held just for employee artwork, so I submitted "Somewhere, 2001". This was my first non-logo design. 

<div class="container">
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <figure class="figure">
             {% image "05-somewhere.jpg",
            "From my days using PaintShop Pro",
            [320, 640, null],
            "320px, 640px, 100vw",
            "figure-img img-fluid rounded"
            %}
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">From my days using PaintShop Pro</figcaption>
        </figure>

## Dreamhost T-Shirt Contest

A post on the Dreamhost blog caught my attention. Not so much the title, which declared the "62nd Birthday of Dreamhost", but the bonus for anyone who designed a retro t-shirt: a lifetime of free hosting. _Update: the blog post has been removed._

I decided to go with a retro 80s theme. The subject fell into place when I was browsing for kitsch: the Rubik's Cube. Even better was that nine squares (3x3) exactly fits the spelling of DRE-AMH-OST. To finish the design I needed something to indicate this shirt was from the 1980s. In a word: dweeb.

The light gray boundary around the design allows for black or white t-shirts to be used without diminishing the impact of the design. Ultimately, it wasn't enough to win the contest.

<div class="container">
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <figure class="figure">
             {% image "06-dweeb-web.png",
            "I lost the contest",
            [250, 500, null],
            "250px, 500px, 100vw",
            "figure-img img-fluid"
            %}
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">I lost the contest</figcaption>

## Women's History Month

The [Women's Studies Program](http://wgst.cah.ucf.edu/) at UCF was looking for a logo to represent Women's History Month 2000. I won the logo contest and got a $150 gift certificate to Barnes and Noble. That bought approximately 1.5 college textbooks for the next semester. 

<div class="container">
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <figure class="figure">
             {% image "07-history-month.gif",
            "I won the contest!",
            [376],
            "376px",
            "figure-img img-fluid"
            %}
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">I won the contest!</figcaption>

## Earth 3D

I decided to take the 2D Earth into three dimensions. But where does an artist find an affordable 3D editor? Bundled on a CD with his video card, that's where. What kind of quality should you expect from such an application? Not much. After hours of adjusting primitive objects I had a new appreciation for 3D modeling. Every aspect came together except for the color gradients.

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

        <video controls class="ratio ratio-16x9 p-3">
        <source src="earth-3d.mp4" 
            type="video/mp4" 
            alt="Recording of my rotating globe logo"
            />
        </video>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">This video shows a rendering of my rotating globe logo</figcaption>
